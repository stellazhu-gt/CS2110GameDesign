(This Is A Game Assignment for CS 2110 HW8)
Hey there! This is a game called **Fight Me or Fight Ghost?:ghost:**
This is C game basically for Nintendo Game Boy Advance.
Sounds silly ikr and it acutally isss :)<br />
Pull it if you just want to see what's going on with gatech CS 2110   <br /><br />

/*I still have not finished the coursed yet when I'm creating this game   <br />
   which means I'm still struggling and finals are up to come. So comeonnn,  <br />
   it's not that bad to be silly sometimes.*/
   
Ok. Time to introduce my silly little game!


HOW TO WIN???
Kill all the ghosts!

HOW TO DIE? (interesting if you ask me this, I actually have an answer
You may either run out your bombs or just been killed :)


(up till now, it can only be loaded in docker //CS2110 mystery platform)
>>>
First of all, you'll be led into the first page of the game. *the welcome game!*
In this page, you can just hit <Start> on GameBoy or <Enter> on keyboard.
(The button may not be fast to reflect. Just be patient :)

>>>
Then! you'll be loaded with the main page, where you can play the game!!

In the page, you'll see four little ghosts.
They have distinct colors but they actually have same effects.
Ok. So now you have a body of Finn Mertens, which you can move around by pressing
<up>, <down>, <left>, <right> buttons on keyboard.

You either hit <A> on GameBoy or <Z> on keyboard to make explosion to bomb ghosts,
if you are around. The ghost will disappear if it has no health and dies.
However, you may also get the chance for been attacked if you are too close.
If you get attacked, you will lose health. The health level shown by the hearts
on top right will give you a sign.

If you have no health left, game over! You'll be led into the failture ending page.

Forfunately, you get a chance for your character EVOLVUTION!!

How to do it? Did you see the burger? Just get there and eat it by pressing
<L> on GameBoy or <A> on keyboard! Avoid colliding with ghosts!

If you successfully get evolved, you'll become a "ghost" as well. With this camouflage,
you can mislead the ghosts and get less attack from them. You'll also be refreshed with
a higher blood level and some other beneficial features! (worth reading to here :)

Now kill all the ghosts and win the game!
