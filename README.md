Hey there! This is a game called **Fight Me or Fight Ghost?:ghost:** <br />
This is C game basically for Nintendo Game Boy Advance.
Sounds silly ikr and it acutally isss :)<br />
Pull it if you just want to see what's going on with gatech CS 2110   <br /><br />
#*I still have not finished the coursed yet when I'm creating this game   <br />
   which means I'm still struggling and finals are up to come. So comeonnn,  <br />
   it's not that bad to be silly sometimes.* :stuck_out_tongue::stuck_out_tongue::stuck_out_tongue:  <br /><br />
Ok. Time to introduce my silly little game!:raised_hands:<br />
<br />

 (up till now, it can only be loaded in docker //CS2110 mystery platform)<br />
First of all, you'll be led into the first page of the game. *the welcome game!*<br />
You can see a page like this :point_down:<br />
![welcome page](https://github.com/stellazhu334/CS2110GameDesign/blob/master/Screen%20Shot%202020-04-03%20at%2010.39.04%20PM.png)<br />
In this page, you can just hit *Start* on GameBoy or *Enter* on keyboard.<br />
(The button may not be fast to reflect. Just be patient :)<br />

Then! you'll be loaded with the main page, where you can play the game!!<br />
You can see a page like this :point_down:<br />
![game page](https://github.com/stellazhu334/CS2110GameDesign/blob/master/Screen%20Shot%202020-04-03%20at%2010.42.27%20PM.png)<br />
In the page, you'll see four little ghosts.<br />
They have distinct colors but they actually have same effects.<br />
Ok. So now you have a body of Finn Mertens, which you can move around by pressing<br />
*up*, *down*, *left*, *right* buttons on keyboard.<br />
![Finn](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e5/FinnAdventureTime.png)<br />

You either hit *A* on GameBoy or *Z* on keyboard to make explosion to bomb ghosts,<br />
if you are around. The ghost will disappear if it has no health and dies.:boom:<br />
However, you may also get the chance for been attacked if you are too close.:shit:<br />
If you get attacked, you will lose health. The health level shown by the hearts<br />
on top right will give you a sign.<br />
Also, you may notice you have only 9 bombs!<br />

If you have no health left, game over! You'll be led into the failture ending page.<br />

Forfunately, you get a chance for your character EVOLVUTION!!:heart_eyes:<br />

How to do it? Did you see the burger? Just get there and eat it by pressing<br />
*L* on GameBoy or *A* on keyboard! Avoid colliding with ghosts!:sweat_drops:<br />

If you successfully get evolved, you'll become a "ghost" as well. With this camouflage,<br />
you can mislead the ghosts and get less attack from them. You'll also be refreshed with<br />
a higher blood level and some other beneficial features! (worth reading to here :):v:<br />

Now kill all the ghosts and win the game!:sunglasses:<br />
